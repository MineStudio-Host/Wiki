# Early Access Program

The **Early Access Program** is a temporary program designed to involve our community in the early stages of our network’s development. This program will be available for a limited time and will conclude no later than three months after the official release of MineStudio Host. Afterward, it will transition into a new "Testers" program.

Participants in the Early Access Program will play a gigantic role in helping prepare and refine our network by providing feedback, identifying issues, and suggesting improvements.

## Perks of Participation

- **Exclusive Chat Tag**: Receive a unique chat tag showing your involvement in the Early Access Program.
- **Recognition**: A heartfelt thanks from the MineStudio Host Team for contributing to the network’s development.
- **Community Impact**: Help shape the future of MineStudio Host by providing valuable feedback and ideas.
## How to Join

Joining the Early Access Program is simple! The application isn't out yet, but check back later!
