# Creator Program
Are you interested in building a server using MineStudio, or already have and want to be part of our growing community of creators? Well, that's exactly what our Creator Program is for!

As a member of the Creator Program, you get access to early sneak peaks, you get to help beta-test (opt-in) new features, and chat with our team directly for extended support. 

As of December 30, 2024, the Creator Program is in early-access, but accepting new members. As the network is unreleased, you'll mainly be helping us design and come up with how you want to be able to develop your server, for example, you'll help us develop CraftLang by providing feedback.

If you're interested in applying, you can do so [here](https://surveys.minestudio.host/index.php/843834?lang=en). Good luck!
