# The Partner Program
The Partner Program is designed for those who don't directly run a server with us, but would still like to collaborate and make something amazing. This could be, but is not limited to; development studios, freelancing servers, community discords, etc.

However, these communities must have a decent enough audience for it to be reasonable for both parties to accept.

As a Partner, you'll gain access to most of the same things our [media program](/programs/media) does, but more tailored towards Partners instead of Media Members. For example, the rank would be [PARTNER], and you wouldn't be participating in our official media sources.

If you're interested in applying, you can do so [here](https://forms.office.com/r/6rfbBUh4ax). Good luck!
